    'Introduction' => '<p>
     Self-taught Modern Art artist, GEM began painting in 2020 when COVID lockdowns kept her away from her children abroad. 
	 To get closer to them virtually, she paints them from photos with dry pastels. 
	 After the pandemic, she joined <a href="http://www.atelier-des-beaux-arts-grasse.fr/">Josy Grant</a>\'s artist studio in Grasse (06) 
	 to learn acrylic and oil techniques.
     <br>Her paintings are essentially figurative, landscape subjects, nature, portraits where bright colors are expressed. She immortalizes 
	 reflections in the varied aquatic landscapes, influenced by her regular trips to Australia.</br>
	 <br>She prepares and develops creations on a tablet with a stylus. This digital sketching phase allows 
	 to appreciate the composition and the color palette before reproducing on canvas, with the chosen technique. 
	 Much of her imagination is fuelled by her own photos. Since 2021, she has been exhibiting regularly in solo or group exhibitions.
